[title] How to Run a Simulation

[subtitle]1. Create a new project.
- Click 'Project' -> 'New Project'. A new tab will appear with a map of the full Mars terrain.

[subtitle]2. Select a bounding box within the map to define an area of interest.
- Click on the map and hold the mouse button to drag a bounding box. 
- If the box is too small, it will appear red, that is because small maps are too pixelated to be useable with the given satellite image.
- Once the mouse is released and the size of the box is adequate, a confirmation and reset button will appear. 
- Click on the 'Confirm' button to zoom into the selected area. Click on the 'Reset' button to redefine the bounding box.

[subtitle]3. Add rover. 
- Once the map is zoomed in, the 'Add Rover' button will appear to be available in the header and on the screen.
- Clicking on the button will display a popup window to select a rover.
- To instantiate a new rover, fill out the 'Create Rover' form, which allows for customizing the pathfinding and rover hardware. 
- When creating a new rover, the rover preset dropdown allows for choosing rover hardware, the specifications linked with the chosen hardware
will appear on the right of the form. 
- The rover's pathfinding can be customized in terms of its main distance calculation method and heuristics. 
- The heuristics are weighted values used for AI pathfinding, the sliders can be used to increase a parameter's priority. 
- Heuristics include: altitude stability, solar exposure, energy efficiency, and low altitude. 

- To select an existing rover previously configured, fill out the 'Existing Rovers' form.

- Once selected, the current rover will show up in the middle of the header.

[subtitle]4. Select path markers.
- At this point, the screen can be clicked to place markers on the map. 
- Place up to 5 markers to visit with the rover.
- When 2 markers are placed, a button 'Find Path' will appear. Once the button is clicked, the path optimized for the chosen rover will be calculated.
- When 3 or more markers are placed, two buttons appear, 'Find Optimal Path' and 'Find Ordered Path'.
- Click 'Find Optimal Path' to calculate the chosen rover's most optimal path for visiting all the markers selected.
- Click 'Find Ordered Path' to calculate the chosen rover's most optimal path for visiting all the markers selected in order.
- Click the "Reset" button to clear all markers and place new ones.

[subtitle]5. View path.
- Once path calculation is instantiated, a progress bar will show up to indicate the generation of the map.
- The map is generated using real Mars terrain data, this can take up to 2 minutes. 
- Then, the progress bar will indicate the computation of the pathfinding algorithm for the chosen rover.
- Once the path is computed, it will appear in blue on the screen. 
- The 'Path and Rover statistics' button will become available, click it to get further information about the simulated path.

[title] Extra Features
[subtitle]1. Creating multiple projects.
- You can have up to 5 tabs open at the same time. The user is be able to switch between the tabs by clicking on the desired tab. 
- These tabs can be created by clicking 'New Project'. 
- A tab can be deleted by clicking the red 'X' button.
- A tab can be renamed by double clicking it, the text will become blue when editable. 
- Once edited, the tab name can be saved by clicking anywhere on the screen or pressing 'Enter'. Press 'Escape' to revert edits.


[subtitle]2. Load, save, delete project
- You can save a project to the database to load it again later on. Click 'Project' -> 'Save Project' to save the current active project. 
- To load a saved project, create a new project and then click 'Project' -> 'Load Project'.
- A list of saved projects will appear if any exist, and the user will be able to select one and load it. It will display the state it was saved at. 
- To delete a project from the database, click 'Project' -> 'Delete Project'.
